%% Main file modelling the temperature distribution of a pipe
% define the constants

% define the matrix

% initial conditions

% loop
    % solve matrix equation for the temperature inside the pipe
    
    % derive the new temperture of the water
    
    % store the new timestep in array
    
% store the simulation in as a file
